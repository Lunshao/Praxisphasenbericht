Class scrartcl Info: You've used standard option `oneside'.
(scrartcl)           This is correct!
(scrartcl)           Internally I'm using `twoside=false'.
(scrartcl)           If you'd like to set the option with \KOMAoptions,
(scrartcl)           you'd have to use `twoside=false' there
(scrartcl)           instead of `oneside', too.


Class scrartcl Warning: You've used obsolete option `liststotoc'.
(scrartcl)              Usage of this option indicates an old document
(scrartcl)              and changes compatibility level using
(scrartcl)              `listof=totoc,version=first,
(scrartcl)              enabledeprecatedfontcommands' that may result
(scrartcl)              in further warnings.
(scrartcl)              If you don't want this, you should simply
(scrartcl)              replace option `liststotoc' by `listof=totoc'.

Class scrartcl Info: Switching compatibility level to `first'.

Class scrartcl Warning: deprecated option `enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.
(scrartcl)              Note, that this option was already depreacted when
(scrartcl)              it has been defined. Support for old font commands
(scrartcl)              has been removed from KOMA-Script more than one
(scrartcl)              decade ago. It is not recommended to use them any
(scrartcl)              longer. Therefore usage of this class option also
(scrartcl)              is not recommended.

Package scrpage2 Warning: seems you are using a very small headheight.
(scrpage2)                If you get overfull \vbox warnings at almost every
(scrpage2)                page, you should increase headheight e.g. writing
(scrpage2)                 \setlength{\headheight}{1.1\baselineskip}
(scrpage2)                into the preamble of your document.
(scrpage2)                A better solution would be to use typearea package.

I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be
spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.

delete the erroneous units; e.g., type `2' to delete
two letters. (See Chapter 27 of The TeXbook.)

If you say, e.g., `\def\a1{...}', then you must always
put `1' after `\a', since control sequence names are
made up of letters only. The macro here has not been
followed by the required stuff, so I'm ignoring it.

If you really absolutely need more capacity,
you can ask a wizard to enlarge me.
